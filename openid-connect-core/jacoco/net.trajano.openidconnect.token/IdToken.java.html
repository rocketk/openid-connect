/**
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;a href=&quot;http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken&quot;&gt;ID
 * Token&lt;/a&gt;. The primary extension that OpenID Connect makes to OAuth 2.0 to
 * enable End-Users to be Authenticated is the ID Token data structure. The ID
 * Token is a security token that contains Claims about the Authentication of an
 * End-User by an Authorization Server when using a Client, and potentially
 * other requested Claims. The ID Token is represented as a JSON Web Token
 * (JWT).
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * ID Tokens MAY contain other Claims. Any Claims used that are not understood
 * MUST be ignored. See Sections 3.1.3.6, 3.3.2.11, 5.1, and 7.4 for additional
 * Claims defined by this specification.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * ID Tokens MUST be signed using JWS [JWS] and optionally both signed and then
 * encrypted using JWS [JWS] and JWE [JWE] respectively, thereby providing
 * authentication, integrity, non-repudiation, and optionally, confidentiality,
 * per Section 16.14. If the ID Token is encrypted, it MUST be signed then
 * encrypted, with the result being a Nested JWT, as defined in [JWT]. ID Tokens
 * MUST NOT use none as the alg value unless the Response Type used returns no
 * ID Token from the Authorization Endpoint (such as when using the
 * Authorization Code Flow) and the Client explicitly requested the use of none
 * at Registration time.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * ID Tokens SHOULD NOT use the JWS or JWE x5u, x5c, jku, or jwk Header
 * Parameter fields. Instead, references to keys used are communicated in
 * advance using Discovery and Registration parameters, per Section 10.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This extends {@link Userinfo} as per
 * http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims which
 * indicates that the claims can be stored in the token as well.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
