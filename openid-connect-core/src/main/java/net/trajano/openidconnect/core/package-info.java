/**
 * <p>
 * <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect
 * Core</a>. OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth
 * 2.0 protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based
 * on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to
 * obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and
 * REST-like manner.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This specification defines the core OpenID Connect functionality:
 * authentication built on top of OAuth 2.0 and the use of Claims to communicate
 * information about the End-User. It also describes the security and privacy
 * considerations for using OpenID Connect.
